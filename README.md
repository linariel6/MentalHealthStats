# NYPD Complaint Data Analysis (2023)

This project focuses on the exploratory data analysis of New York Police Department (NYPD) 
Complaint Data for the year 2023. The dataset was obtained from the NYC Open Data website via 
this link: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Complaint-Data-Historic/qgea-i56i/about_data.

This dataset contains various information, including the exact date, time, and location of a 
complaint occurrence, offense descriptions, and many other useful details for analysis. Our 
group aims to analyze trends and patterns in the types of complaints, including their associated 
crime categories, across different boroughs of NYC in 2023. This will be achieved by creating 
visualizations to understand the spatial and temporal complaint patterns reported to the NYPD, 
ultimately generating useful insights to better support NYC public health.
