    "text": "1 Introduction\nEvery day, countless crime incidents occur around us, reflecting the complexities of urban life. New York City, as one of the most famous and densely populated cities in the world, experiences a wide range of crimes at varying levels, with numerous cases reported every day. The city’s complexity, diversity, and high volume of cases present significant challenges for government and police in managing and preventing crime effectively. To help enhance public safety, understand crime patterns such as time ranges and crime levels, and identify areas where resources can be allocated more effectively, we decided to analyze the New York City Police Department (NYPD) Complaint Data Historic dataset.The dataset was obtained from the New York City Open Data platform and contains detailed information on crimes reported to the NYPD from 2006 to 2024.Comprising 8.91 million rows and 35 columns, it offers a comprehensive view of crime trends and patterns during this period. For our analysis, we decided to focus on the most recent complete year of data available from 2023, which contains approximately 520,000 records. By analyzing the latest data, we aim to uncover patterns and developments that can inform timely and relevant strategies for crime prevention and resource allocation. For example, identifying high-risk locations can help individuals make informed decisions about the safest times to stay home or take extra precautions, while also guiding law enforcement on where to allocate additional police resources effectively.",

    "text": "2.1 Description\nThe dataset that we will use to to investigate the latest criminal trends for more effective allocation of public safety resources is the NYPD Complaint Data Historic dataset that can be found on the NYC Open Data site. This dataset contains a record of every criminal complaint reported to the New York City Police Department (NYPD) from 2006 to 2023. For the purpose of our analysis, we will be only using data from the year of 2023. The dataset was manually queried quarterly from the NYPD system of record, and it reflects all reported complaints available at the time of extraction. The extracted data is then reviewed by the Office of Management Analysis and Planning, and it gets published and updated to the NYC Open Data site annually. Each observation of the dataset is a criminal complaint that was filed in NYC. For the year of 2023, there are 543,331 observations with 35 columns documenting relevant information, including but not limited to the exact date, time, location, offense type, level of offense, and details of the suspect and victim of a complaint. There are no major issues with this dataset, except that according to the dataset footnote, when information was not available or unknown at the time of the complaint report, the fields would be entered as “Unknown/Not Available/Not Reported” or simply, just left as null, and when read into R, null would be interpreted as “(null),” so there are conversions our team needs to do to make the NA or unknown values consistent. Moreover, during initial data exploration, in the SUSP_SEX and VIC_SEX columns, there are uncommon and unknown values that our team needs to identify. Other than common “M”, “F,” representing male and female gender, there are other values such as “E,” “L,” “U.” Our team suspects “U” for unknown. However, no information is provided anywhere about the meaning of these abbreviations.\nOur team would import the data directly into R using the read.csv() function, since this dataset is publicly downloadable from the NYC Open Data website as a CSV file.",

    "text": "2.2 Missing value analysis\nThere are many columns with missing values after our team converts “Unknown” and “(null)” strings to NA’s. We left “U” in the gender columns as is for now since we have no evidence of it representing unknown.\n\nOut of the 35 columns, there are 13 columns containing no missing values, 9 columns having less than 1 percent missing values, 8 columns containing missing values in the range of 5% to 50%, and the remaining 5 columns containing missing values over 90%.\n\nAcross different months of the year, the number of missing values across all columns remains fairly consistent. The missing value counts always fall at around 300,000. Our team also notices that for shorter months with 30 days or 28 days (February 2023), the missing value counts are always lower than those for longer months with 31 days.\n\n\n\nCorrelation of Missing Data Between Columns\n\n\nFrom the correlation coefficients of column missing values, we observe that when the X_COORD_CD or Y_COORD_CD values are missing, the LATITUDE and LONGITUDE values will always be missing. Moreover, when PD_CD values are missing, PD_DESC will also be missing; when TRANSIT_DISTRICT data is missing, the STATION_NAME information will also be missing. Furthermore, when VIC_AGE_GROUP is missing, it is very likely that the VIC_RACE information will be missing.",
