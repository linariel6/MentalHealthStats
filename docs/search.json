    "text": "1 Introduction\nEvery day, countless crime incidents occur around us, reflecting the complexities of urban life. New York City, as one of the most famous and densely populated cities in the world, experiences a wide range of crimes at varying levels, with numerous cases reported every day. The city’s complexity, diversity, and high volume of cases present significant challenges for government and police in managing and preventing crime effectively. To help enhance public safety, understand crime patterns such as time ranges and crime levels, and identify areas where resources can be allocated more effectively, we decided to analyze the New York City Police Department (NYPD) Complaint Data Historic dataset.The dataset was obtained from the New York City Open Data platform and contains detailed information on crimes reported to the NYPD from 2006 to 2024. Comprising 8.91 million rows and 35 columns, it offers a comprehensive view of crime trends and patterns during this period. For our analysis, we decided to focus on data spanning the most recent five years (2019–2023), which includes approximately 1.4 million records. We will first focus on long-term trends to understand how crime densities evolve over time. Then, we will dive deeper into the most recent crime patterns happening in 2023, which contains about 520 thousand records. By analyzing the most recent data, we aim to uncover patterns and developments that can inform timely and relevant strategies for crime prevention and resource allocation. For example, identifying high-risk locations can help individuals make informed decisions about the safest times to stay home or take extra precautions, while also guiding law enforcement on where to allocate additional police resources effectively.",

    "text": "2.1 Description\nThe dataset that we will use to to investigate the latest criminal trend for more effective allocation of public safety resources is the NYPD Complaint Data Historic dataset that can be found on the NYC Open Data site. This dataset contains a record of every criminal complaint reported to the New York City Police Department (NYPD) from 2006 to 2023. For our analysis on the most recent trend, we will only be using the records from 2019 to 2023. This dataset was manually queried quarterly from the NYPD system of record, and it reflects all reported complaints available at the time of extraction. The extracted data is then reviewed by the Office of Management Analysis and Planning, and it gets published and updated to the NYC Open Data site annually. Each observation is a criminal complaint that was filed in NYC. From 2019 to 2023, there are 2,395,849 observations with 35 columns documenting relevant information, including but not limited to the exact date, time, location, offense type, level of offense, and details of the suspect and victim of a complaint. There are no major issues with this dataset, except that according to the footnote, when information was not available or unknown at the time of the complaint report, the fields would be entered as “Unknown/Not Available/Not Reported” or simply, just left as null, and when read into R, null would be interpreted as “(null),” so there are conversions our team needs to do to make the NA or unknown values consistent. Moreover, during initial data exploration, in the SUSP_SEX and VIC_SEX columns, there are uncommon and unknown values that our team needs to identify. Other than common “M”, “F,” representing male and female gender, there are other values such as “E,” “L,” “U.” Our team suspects “U” for unknown. However, no information is provided anywhere about the meaning of these abbreviations.\nTo conduct exploratory data analysis on this dataset, our team imported the data into R using the read_csv() function, since this dataset is publicly available for download in CSV format from the NYC Open Data website.",

    "text": "2.2 Missing value analysis\nThere are many columns with missing values after our team converts “Unknown” and “(null)” strings to NA’s. We left “U” in the gender columns as is for now since we have no evidence of it representing unknown.\n\nOut of the 35 columns, there are 10 columns containing no missing values, 13 columns having less than 1 percent missing values, 7 columns containing missing values in the range of 5% to 60%, and the remaining 5 columns containing missing values over 90%.\n\nAcross different months of the year, the number of missing values across all columns remains fairly consistent. The missing value count always falls at around 1 to 1.5 million for each month. Our team also notices that shorter months with 30 days or fewer generally have lower missing value counts compared to longer months with 31 days. However, an exception occurs toward the end of the year, where December has a lower missing value count compared to November.\n\n\n\nCorrelation of Missing Data Between Columns\n\n\nFrom the correlation coefficients of column missing values, we observe that when the X_COORD_CD or Y_COORD_CD values are missing, the LATITUDE and LONGITUDE values will always be missing. Moreover, when PD_CD values are missing, PD_DESC will also be missing; when TRANSIT_DISTRICT data is missing, the STATION_NAME information will also be missing. Furthermore, when VIC_AGE_GROUP is missing, it is very likely that the VIC_RACE information will be missing.\nNote: Please refer to analysis_code.qmd for detailed code implementation.",

    "text": "Below you can find an interactive visualization representing the change in NYPD complaints density across the five boroughs of New York City over a 24-hour range. Each grid corresponds to a square mile in a borough, and the dots represent the average number of complaint counts in a square mile at a specific hour, based on data averaged over a five-year period (2019–2023). The density of complaints is visualized by the number of dots within each grid. Try using the slider below to explore how complaint density changes across different hours of the day and different boroughs!\n\n\nAverage Crime Count per Square Mile per Hour\n\n  \n\nComplaints at Hour 0 (0:00 to 0:59)\n\n\nThis component was built by calculating the average number of recorded complaints across different hours of the day over a five-year period. The counts for each borough were then divided by the borough’s land area to determine the average number of complaints occurring per square mile per hour. The borough area data was sourced from this link.\n\n\nAs you can observe, across different hours of the day, Manhattan consistently has the highest number of crimes per square mile per hour. Down the line, we have Manhattan, the Bronx, Brooklyn, and Queens show progressively lower crime densities. Staten Island has the lowest crime density, possibly due to its smaller population. Throughout the different hours, for all boroughs, a trend of crime densities decreasing from midnight to the lowest at around 6 AM in the morning can be observed. Densities then increase again from 7 AM to around 5 PM, reaching the maximum, before going down again as we get into the night. This information suggests that more resources should be allocated in the afternoon and in areas with higher densities such as Manhattan.",
