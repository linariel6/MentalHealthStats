    "text": "1 Introduction\nEvery day, countless crime incidents occur around us, reflecting the complexities of urban life. New York City, as one of the most famous and densely populated cities in the world, experiences a wide range of crimes at varying levels, with numerous cases reported every day. The city’s complexity, diversity, and high volume of cases present significant challenges for government and police in managing and preventing crime effectively. To help enhance public safety, understand crime patterns such as time ranges and crime levels, and identify areas where resources can be allocated more effectively, we decided to analyze the New York City Police Department (NYPD) Complaint Data Historic dataset.The dataset was obtained from the New York City Open Data platform and contains detailed information on crimes reported to the NYPD from 2006 to 2024. Comprising 8.91 million rows and 35 columns, it offers a comprehensive view of crime trends and patterns during this period. For our analysis, we decided to focus on data spanning the most recent five years (2019–2023), which includes approximately 1.4 million records. We will first focus on long-term trends to understand how crime densities evolve over time. Then, we will dive deeper into the most recent crime patterns happening in 2023, which contains about 520 thousand records. By analyzing the most recent data, we aim to uncover patterns and developments that can inform timely and relevant strategies for crime prevention and resource allocation. For example, identifying high-risk locations can help individuals make informed decisions about the safest times to stay home or take extra precautions, while also guiding law enforcement on where to allocate additional police resources effectively.",

    "text": "2.1 Description\nThe dataset that we will use to to investigate the latest criminal trend for more effective allocation of public safety resources is the NYPD Complaint Data Historic dataset that can be found on the NYC Open Data site. This dataset contains a record of every criminal complaint reported to the New York City Police Department (NYPD) from 2006 to 2023. For our analysis on the most recent trend, we will only be using the records from 2019 to 2023. This dataset was manually queried quarterly from the NYPD system of record, and it reflects all reported complaints available at the time of extraction. The extracted data is then reviewed by the Office of Management Analysis and Planning, and it gets published and updated to the NYC Open Data site annually. Each observation is a criminal complaint that was filed in NYC. From 2019 to 2023, there are 2,395,849 observations with 35 columns documenting relevant information, including but not limited to the exact date, time, location, offense type, level of offense, and details of the suspect and victim of a complaint. There are no major issues with this dataset, except that according to the footnote, when information was not available or unknown at the time of the complaint report, the fields would be entered as “Unknown/Not Available/Not Reported” or simply, just left as null, and when read into R, null would be interpreted as “(null),” so there are conversions our team needs to do to make the NA or unknown values consistent. Moreover, during initial data exploration, in the SUSP_SEX and VIC_SEX columns, there are uncommon and unknown values that our team needs to identify. Other than common “M”, “F,” representing male and female gender, there are other values such as “E,” “L,” “U.” Our team suspects “U” for unknown. However, no information is provided anywhere about the meaning of these abbreviations.\nTo conduct exploratory data analysis on this dataset, our team imported the data into R using the read_csv() function, since this dataset is publicly available for download in CSV format from the NYC Open Data website.",

    "text": "2.2 Missing value analysis\nThere are many columns with missing values after our team converts “Unknown” and “(null)” strings to NA’s. We left “U” in the gender columns as is for now since we have no evidence of it representing unknown.\n\nOut of the 35 columns, there are 10 columns containing no missing values, 13 columns having less than 1 percent missing values, 7 columns containing missing values in the range of 5% to 60%, and the remaining 5 columns containing missing values over 90%.\n\nAcross different months of the year, the number of missing values across all columns remains fairly consistent. The missing value count always falls at around 1 to 1.5 million for each month. Our team also notices that shorter months with 30 days or fewer generally have lower missing value counts compared to longer months with 31 days. However, an exception occurs toward the end of the year, where December has a lower missing value count compared to November.\n\n\n\nCorrelation of Missing Data Between Columns\n\n\nFrom the correlation coefficients of column missing values, we observe that when the X_COORD_CD or Y_COORD_CD values are missing, the LATITUDE and LONGITUDE values will always be missing. Moreover, when PD_CD values are missing, PD_DESC will also be missing; when TRANSIT_DISTRICT data is missing, the STATION_NAME information will also be missing. Furthermore, when VIC_AGE_GROUP is missing, it is very likely that the VIC_RACE information will be missing.\nNote: Please refer to InitialAnalysis.qmd for detailed code implementation.",

    "text": "Yearly Crime Trends: The Pandemic’s Impact and Beyond\nBeginning our exploration of crime patterns in New York City, we start with a yearly analysis of crime incidents over the past five years (Figure 1). As shown in the yearly line graph, in 2019, there were approximately 460,000 reported crime incidents. The following year, 2020, saw a significant decline, with the number of incidents dropping to around 418,000. This reduction was likely influenced by the unprecedented circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic, where stringent lockdowns and reduced public interactions curtailed opportunities for criminal activity. As the city adapted and began to recover from the pandemic, crime rates started to climb. In 2021, the number of reported incidents increased to approximately 460,000, matching pre-pandemic levels. This upward trend continued into 2022, with reported incidents rising further to about 500,000. By 2023, the figure reached a peak of around 545,000.The line graph highlights the clear increase in crime incidents over the past few years and underscores the need for the allocation of additional police resources, alongside the development of comprehensive policies that address the root causes of crime.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. The change in crime patterns form 2019 to 2023\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Borough Perspective: Where Crime Has Changed the Most:\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2. % Change of crime count in different patrol boroughs\n\n\n\nTo delve deeper into the observed increase in crime incidents, we next examine the distribution of reported crimes across the eight patrol boroughs in New York City. By comparing data from 2019 and 2023, we aim to identify which boroughs experienced the most significant changes and how the increase in crime is distributed geographically (Figure 2). This analysis provides a more localized perspective on borough-specific trends. As shown in the graph, Queens North recorded the most significant percentage increase, with crime incidents rising by 36.1% between 2019 and 2023. Staten Island followed with a 28.2% increase, and Queens South saw a 23.6% rise. However, when considering the absolute number of incidents, the Bronx stands out, despite its percentage increase of 17.1% not being the highest. The Bronx’s substantial base number of reported crimes in 2019 means it contributed the largest absolute increase in crime incidents over the four years. Similarly, Brooklyn North and Brooklyn South, with percentage increases of 16.7% and 12.3%, respectively, also saw significant absolute rises due to their relatively high baseline crime numbers in 2019. Meanwhile, Manhattan South and Manhattan North, despite their percentage increases of 10.4% and 15.2%, respectively, contributed smaller absolute increases compared to other boroughs due to their lower initial figures.\n\n\nSeasonality Matters: Monthly Crime Trends Across the Boroughs:\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3. Monthly crime pattern across different patrol boroughs\n\n\n\nWhile the yearly trends provide a high-level overview of the rise in crime incidents, they fail to capture the temporal variations that occur within each year. To better understand the dynamics of crime, monthly crime trends were plotted for each borough from 2019 to 2023 (Figure 3). Interestingly, most boroughs show a seasonal trend where crime rates tend to rise in the warmer months (June to August) and decline slightly toward the end of the year. February generally records fewer crime incidents compared to other months, with all boroughs showing a noticeable drop in reported crimes during this period. These seasonal patterns held consistent across all five years and suggest that external factors, such as weather, public holidays, and changes in societal behaviors, play a significant role in influencing crime levels throughout the year. Additionally, across most boroughs, crime incidents exhibited a notable dip during the early months of 2020, reflecting the impact of strict COVID-19 lockdown measures.",

    "text": "A Closer Look at 2023: Insights from the Most Recent Data:\n\nWeekly Crime Patterns: Borough Insights for 2023\nHaving explored the general crime trends over the past five years, we now shift our focus to a more detailed examination of the most recent year, 2023. By analyzing weekly crime data (Figure 4), we gain insights into the short-term fluctuations and patterns that characterize crime incidents across the boroughs in this year. As shown in Figure 4, the Bronx stands out as the borough with the highest weekly crime counts, maintaining a significantly elevated level compared to other boroughs throughout the year. Brooklyn North and Brooklyn South follow closely, while boroughs such as Queens South and Staten Island consistently report lower weekly crime incidents. Interestingly, the graph highlights periodic fluctuations in weekly crime rates, particularly during the summer months, which align with the seasonal peak observed in the monthly analysis. Additionally, the latter part of the year sees a gradual decline in weekly crime incidents across most boroughs.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4. Weekly crime trend across different patrol boroughs\n\n\n\n\n\nCrime Hour by Hour: Daily Rhythms Across Boroughs\nBeyond weekly patterns, a more detailed analysis of hourly trends can help us understand the daily rhythms of crime and how they vary across different boroughs in 2023. As illustrated in Figure 5, a consistent hourly pattern emerges across all boroughs. Crime rates gradually decrease from midnight (12 AM) to the early morning hours (6 AM), reaching their lowest levels during this period. Following this, crime incidents steadily rise throughout the day, peaking during the late afternoon and evening hours (3 PM to 8 PM). This pattern aligns with typical daily activity cycles, where increased public interactions and greater movement of people likely lead to higher crime rates during these hours.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5. Crime pattern in different hours of the day\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere Crime Happens: Patterns by Premises Type\nHaving explored how crime fluctuates by hour across boroughs, we now turn our attention to how these incidents vary by premises type. By grouping crimes based on the type of location where they occurred (Figure 6), we can better understand how different environments influence the timing and density of criminal activity throughout the day.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6. Crime premises type variations throughout the day\n\n\n\nAs shown in the heatmap in Figure 6, commercial establishments, such as stores and businesses, exhibit a pronounced peak in crime density during the afternoon and early evening hours (12 PM to 8 PM), aligning with their busiest operating hours. Similarly, transit and travel facilities and residential areas experience higher crime densities during morning and evening commuting hours. Educational and medical facilities exhibit the highest density of crime during the hours of 8 AM to 3 PM, likely corresponding to school and hospital operating hours. These premises stand out with the most intense color on the heatmap, indicating the highest crime density among all groups during these hours.\nSimilarly, religious locations show higher crime densities during daylight hours, from 8 AM to 7 PM, reflecting periodic gatherings or events typically held during these times. In contrast, outdoor and public areas display a distinct pattern, with crime density increasing notably as the sun goes down, peaking between 4 PM and 11 PM. This trend may be attributed to increased social and recreational activities in public spaces during the evening hours. On the other hand, all premises types show consistently low crime density during the early morning hours, from 12 AM to 6 AM, reflecting a general decline in activity during these times.\n\n\nCrime Offense Types Through the Day: Variations by Morning, Afternoon, Evening, and Night\nAfter identifying the most frequent premises locations, we now explore some of the most prominent crime categories. Figure 7 demonstrates a heatmap of different crime categories distributed across various times of the day in each borough. Each heatmap sums to 100%, indicating the relative frequency of each crime category for that borough and time period. Given this information, our team observed that Theft was one of the most frequent categories, followed by Violence. Theft most frequently happens in the afternoon (12 PM to 5 PM), whereas Violence most frequently occurs at night (9 PM to 5 AM) across all patrolling boroughs. Burglaries also tend to occur more often at night, but the difference in frequency is relatively small compared to the differences observed for Theft and Violence. For drug-related offenses, boroughs like MANHATTAN-NORTH, QUEENS SOUTH, and STATEN ISLAND showed slightly higher frequencies during the afternoon and evening (5 PM to 9 PM), but the differences were also less pronounced compared to other categories. These findings suggest that more patrolling during afternoon hours might help address Theft, while increased enforcement at night could reduce Violence and Burglaries in all boroughs of NYC.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7. Crime offense type variations throughout the day\n\n\n\n\n\nCrime and Gender: Analyzing Suspect Demographics Across Boroughs\nUnderstanding crime patterns also involves exploring the demographics of suspects. By analyzing the distribution of suspect sex across boroughs, we gain deeper insights into how criminal activities differ among different groups. We examine how reported incidents vary by borough and suspect sex in 2023 (Figure 8). It is important to note that suspect sex refers to individuals identified as suspects in criminal activities. This bar chart highlights the proportions of male, female, and other suspect sex categories in each borough.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8. Crime count and suspect gender across different patrol boroughs\n\n\n\nAcross all boroughs, male suspects consistently account for the majority of reported crimes. For example, in the Bronx, 50.6% of crimes were attributed to male suspects, the highest percentage among all boroughs. Similarly, Queens North (59.1%) and Brooklyn North (51.7%) show high male representation. Female suspects represent a smaller but significant portion of reported crimes, ranging from 11.1% in Manhattan South to 16.9% in Staten Island. Notably, Staten Island has the highest proportion of female suspects compared to other boroughs.\nThe category labeled “Other” includes suspects whose sex is unidentified or falls outside traditional categories. This group shows considerable variation across boroughs, with Manhattan North and Brooklyn North recording relatively higher percentages of 35.4% and 36.4%, respectively.\n\n\nAge Dynamics in Crime: Suspect and Victim Interactions\nLooking at age groups interactions, it was found that the most frequent suspect-to-victim interactions occur within the 25-44 age group. Additionally, the distribution of victim age groups is broader compared to suspects, as indicated by the wider spread of colors for victims across all age categories (Figure 9). This suggests that more resources should be allocated to neighborhoods with a higher concentration of middle-aged adults.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9. Suspect and victim age group interactions\n\n\n\n\n\nCrime Severity Across Boroughs: Patterns of Violations, Misdemeanors, and Felonies\nNow we examine whether there’s a correlation between offense severity and borough, with severity levels classified as follows, from least to most severe: VIOLATION, MISDEMEANOR, and FELONY. The boroughs remain the same as before, which are different patrol areas (boroughs) as recorded in the dataset. It was observed that the distribution of each severity level is fairly consistent across the patrol boroughs (Figure 10). Only STATEN ISLAND had a relatively lower proportion of FELONY cases. However, this could be attributed to STATEN ISLAND’s lower population, leading to fewer crimes and observations overall. MANHATTAN-SOUTH had a slightly higher relative proportion of MISDEMEANOR cases, but the difference was still not significant. These findings suggest that there’s a very weak to no correlation between the severity of crimes and the borough in which they occur. Additionally, it was noted that the BRONX had a higher number of complaints filed compared to other boroughs.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.Crime severity across patrol boroughs\n\n\n\n\n\nGeographic Crime Distribution: Hotspots Across New York City\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11. Geographic crime distribution across NYC\n\n\n\nBuilding on the previous analyses of time, suspect demographics, categories, and premises, Figure 11 provides a spatial perspective on crime distribution across New York City boroughs. It illustrates the sampled 25,000 observations across the entire city, with each patrolling borough’s sample size proportional to its representation in the overall dataset. Although the sizes of the patrolling areas differ, we can still identify that STATEN ISLAND has a relatively lower volume of reported crimes, whereas MANHATTAN SOUTH and the BRONX exhibit the highest densities. This pattern is further supported by the difference in count of crimes occurring in each patrolling area, as shown in Figure 4. The geographic distribution also highlights areas within each borough where crime density is higher. For instance, in QUEENS NORTH, the densest area appears to be located around longitude -73.88 and latitude 40.75, likely representing a specific neighborhood with more concentrated crime activity. Therefore, further investigation could be conducted to identify these neighborhoods and allocate resources accordingly in these more concentrated areas.\nNote: Please refer to analysis2.qmd for detailed code implementation.",

    "text": "Below you can find an interactive visualization representing the change in NYPD complaints density across the five boroughs of New York City over a 24-hour range. Each grid corresponds to a square mile in a borough, and the dots represent the average number of complaint counts in a square mile at a specific hour, based on data averaged over a five-year period (2019–2023). The density of complaints is visualized by the number of dots within each grid. Try using the slider below to explore how complaint density changes across different hours of the day and different boroughs!\n\n\nAverage Crime Count per Square Mile per Hour\n\n  \n\nComplaints at Hour 0 (0:00 to 0:59)\n\n\nThis component was built by calculating the average number of recorded complaints across different hours of the day over a five-year period. The counts for each borough were then divided by the borough’s land area to determine the average number of complaints occurring per square mile per hour. The borough area data was sourced from this link.\n\n\nAs you can observe, across different hours of the day, Manhattan consistently has the highest number of crimes per square mile per hour. Down the line, we have Manhattan, the Bronx, Brooklyn, and Queens show progressively lower crime densities. Staten Island has the lowest crime density, possibly due to its smaller population. Throughout the different hours, for all boroughs, a trend of crime densities decreasing from midnight to the lowest at around 6 AM in the morning can be observed. Densities then increase again from 7 AM to around 5 PM, reaching the maximum, before going down again as we get into the night. This information suggests that more resources should be allocated in the afternoon and in areas with higher densities such as Manhattan.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "Main Finding:\nOver the years, crime incidents in New York City have steadily increased, particularly after the initial decline in 2020 due to COVID-19 lockdowns. By 2023, crime reached its highest levels, emphasizing the need for the strategic allocation of police resources and policies addressing underlying causes. Borough-specific analysis shows that Queens North experienced the largest percentage increase, while the Bronx contributed the most significant absolute increase, highlighting the need for a localized focus on these areas. Seasonal and temporal analyses reveal distinct patterns. Crime incidents tend to peak during the summer months and are lowest in February, suggesting that increased enforcement during warmer months could help mitigate crime. Hourly crime patterns show that incidents are lowest during the early morning hours from 12 AM to 6 AM, aligning with the period when most people are asleep. Crime numbers then gradually rise throughout the day, reaching their peak during the late afternoon and evening hours (3 PM to 8 PM) across all boroughs. Individuals working in or residing near educational and medical facilities should take extra precautions during their operating hours, typically from 8 AM to 3 PM, as these locations experience higher crime densities during these times.\nDemographic and severity analyses further reveal that male suspects dominate crime statistics, with boroughs like the Bronx and Queens North showing the highest male representation. The majority of offenses are misdemeanors, but the Bronx records more felony complaints compared to other boroughs. Theft and violence are the most frequent crime categories, with theft peaking in the afternoon and violence at night, suggesting the need for increased afternoon and night time enforcement.\nGeographically, hotspots in boroughs like the Bronx, Queens North, and Manhattan South require more attention due to concentrated crime activity. Age dynamics reveal that most crimes involve suspects and victims aged 25–44, underscoring the importance of targeted interventions for this demographic. Educational campaigns and community engagement initiatives tailored to this group could be beneficial.\n\n\nLimitations and Future Directions:\nThis analysis has several limitations that should be addressed in future research. First, the aggregation of data at the borough level provides a broad overview but may obscure important crime patterns at the neighborhood level. As a result, localized hotspots within each borough might be overlooked. Future analyses should incorporate more granular data to explore trends at the neighborhood level within each borough, providing a clearer understanding of specific high-crime areas.\nAnother limitation lies in the dataset, which only includes the count of reported crime incidents within each borough but does not provide information on the population size of neighborhoods. Without considering population density, this analysis cannot account for variations in crime rates per capita, which could significantly affect the interpretation of results. Future studies should seek to integrate population data, if available, to normalize crime counts and better assess crime risk relative to the population size of each area. If population data remains unavailable, proxy measures such as land area or estimates from external demographic datasets could be explored to enhance the accuracy of the analysis.\nFurthermore, the analysis is based solely on reported crime incidents, which may not reflect the full scope of criminal activity due to underreporting or reporting biases. Certain types of crimes or communities may be more prone to underreporting, leading to skewed data. Additionally, the analysis does not account for external factors such as law enforcement policies, economic conditions, or community programs that could have influenced crime trends during the analyzed period. Including these factors could provide additional context and a more comprehensive understanding of the findings. For instance, changes in policing strategies might contribute to sudden increases or decreases in crime, while economic hardships could drive specific types of offenses. Future research could focus on integrating these external influences to better understand their interplay with crime trends and to inform more targeted and effective policy decisions and resource allocation strategies.\n\n\nLesson Learned:\nThroughout this project, we gained valuable insights into both the technical and analytical aspects of studying crime patterns. One of the key takeaways was learning how to use GitHub’s branching feature to collaborate effectively with teammates, ensuring smooth version control and integration of everyone’s contributions. We also learned to balance the complexity of advanced visualization techniques with the simplicity and clarity of basic visualizations, ensuring that the chosen approach effectively communicates the data insights. For the D3 interactivity part, I learned that the trade-off between functionality and complexity is crucial, especially given the limited time for this project. While we could brainstorm great ideas for advanced interactivity, our short timeline and limited experience made it challenging to ensure that a complex and ambitious idea would be implemented effectively with smooth execution. Therefore, focusing on a simple yet functional design that effectively communicates a key insight from the analysis is far more impactful and achievable. This experience has significantly improved our technical proficiency, collaborative skills, and ability to critically analyze and communicate data-driven insights.",
