# Conclusion

#### **Main Finding:** {.unnumbered}

Over the years, crime incidents in New York City have steadily increased, particularly after the initial decline in 2020 due to COVID-19 lockdowns. By 2023, crime reached its highest levels, emphasizing the need for the strategic allocation of police resources and policies addressing underlying causes. Borough-specific analysis shows that Queens North experienced the largest percentage increase, while the Bronx contributed the most significant absolute increase, highlighting the need for a localized focus on these areas. Seasonal and temporal analyses reveal distinct patterns. Crime incidents tend to peak during the summer months and are lowest in February, suggesting that increased enforcement during warmer months could help mitigate crime. Hourly crime patterns show that incidents are lowest during the early morning hours from 12 AM to 6 AM, aligning with the period when most people are asleep. Crime numbers then gradually rise throughout the day, reaching their peak during the late afternoon and evening hours (3 PM to 8 PM) across all boroughs. Individuals working in or residing near educational and medical facilities should take extra precautions during their operating hours, typically from 8 AM to 3 PM, as these locations experience higher crime densities during these times.

Demographic and severity analyses further reveal that male suspects dominate crime statistics, with boroughs like the Bronx and Queens North showing the highest male representation. The majority of offenses are misdemeanors, but the Bronx records more felony complaints compared to other boroughs. Theft and violence are the most frequent crime categories, with theft peaking in the afternoon and violence at night, suggesting the need for increased afternoon and night time enforcement.

Geographically, hotspots in boroughs like the Bronx, Queens North, and Manhattan South require more attention due to concentrated crime activity. Age dynamics reveal that most crimes involve suspects and victims aged 25â€“44, underscoring the importance of targeted interventions for this demographic. Educational campaigns and community engagement initiatives tailored to this group could be beneficial.

#### **Limitations and Future Directions:** {.unnumbered}

This analysis has several limitations that should be addressed in future research. First, the aggregation of data at the borough level provides a broad overview but may obscure important crime patterns at the neighborhood level. As a result, localized hotspots within each borough might be overlooked. Future analyses should incorporate more granular data to explore trends at the neighborhood level within each borough, providing a clearer understanding of specific high-crime areas.

Another limitation lies in the dataset, which only includes the count of reported crime incidents within each borough but does not provide information on the population size of neighborhoods. Without considering population density, this analysis cannot account for variations in crime rates per capita, which could significantly affect the interpretation of results. Future studies should seek to integrate population data, if available, to normalize crime counts and better assess crime risk relative to the population size of each area. If population data remains unavailable, proxy measures such as land area or estimates from external demographic datasets could be explored to enhance the accuracy of the analysis.

Furthermore, the analysis is based solely on reported crime incidents, which may not reflect the full scope of criminal activity due to underreporting or reporting biases. Certain types of crimes or communities may be more prone to underreporting, leading to skewed data. Additionally, the analysis does not account for external factors such as law enforcement policies, economic conditions, or community programs that could have influenced crime trends during the analyzed period. Including these factors could provide additional context and a more comprehensive understanding of the findings. For instance, changes in policing strategies might contribute to sudden increases or decreases in crime, while economic hardships could drive specific types of offenses. Future research could focus on integrating these external influences to better understand their interplay with crime trends and to inform more targeted and effective policy decisions and resource allocation strategies.

#### **Lesson Learned:** {.unnumbered}

Throughout this project, we gained valuable insights into both the technical and analytical aspects of studying crime patterns. One of the key takeaways was learning how to use GitHub's branching feature to collaborate effectively with teammates, ensuring smooth version control and integration of everyone's contributions. We also learned to balance the complexity of advanced visualization techniques with the simplicity and clarity of basic visualizations, ensuring that the chosen approach effectively communicates the data insights. For the D3 interactivity part, I learned that the trade-off between functionality and complexity is crucial, especially given the limited time for this project. While we could brainstorm great ideas for advanced interactivity, our short timeline and limited experience made it challenging to ensure that a complex and ambitious idea would be implemented effectively with smooth execution. Therefore, focusing on a simple yet functional design that effectively communicates a key insight from the analysis is far more impactful and achievable. This experience has significantly improved our technical proficiency, collaborative skills, and ability to critically analyze and communicate data-driven insights.
