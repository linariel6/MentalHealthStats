# Introduction
Every day, countless crime incidents occur around us, reflecting the complexities of urban life. New York City, as one of the most famous and densely populated cities in the world, experiences a wide range of crimes at varying levels, with numerous cases reported every day.The city's complexity, diversity, and high volume of cases present significant challenges for government and police in managing and preventing crime effectively. To help enhance public safety, understand crime patterns such as time ranges and crime levels, and identify areas where resources can be allocated more effectively, we decided to analyze the New York City Police Department (NYPD) Complaint Data Historic dataset.The dataset was obtained from the New York City Open Data platform and contains detailed information on crimes reported to the New York City Police Department (NYPD) from 2006 to 2024.Comprising 8.91 million rows and 35 columns, it offers a comprehensive view of crime trends and patterns during this period. For our analysis, we decided to focus on the most recent complete year of data available from 2023, which contains approximately 520,000 records. By analyzing the latest data, we aim to uncover patterns and developments that can inform timely and relevant strategies for crime prevention and resource allocation. For example, identifying high-risk locations can help individuals make informed decisions about the safest times to stay home or take extra precautions, while also guiding law enforcement on where to allocate additional police resources effectively.
